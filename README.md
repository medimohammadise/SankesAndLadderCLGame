# Snakes and Ladders Game - A Java Command Line Sample Practice
When I was a child I used to play SnakesAndLadder game with my brothers . Still I like this game because even though it is related to dice and chance You can learn that even though Ladders can help You to go up but mistakes could be harmful to your life  and rollback all your efforts .

## problem
    There is one square board (n*n) containing multiple squares inside . We put a unique sequence for each square. Player starts from first square and by throwing a dice will start walking and taking adventures .Adventures could be one of the following things:
    1- Snake  : If player put his/her step in snake's square will get sniffed by the snake.   
    2- Ladder : If Player put his/her step in some squares it might be a ladder and can expedite the trip.  Winner is the one that who reach last square
