# Snakes and Ladders Game - A Java Command Line Sample Practice
When I was a child I used to play SnakesAndLadder game with my brothers . Still I like this game because even though it is related to dice and chance You can learn that even though Ladders can help You to go up but mistakes could be harmful to your life  and rollback all your efforts .
